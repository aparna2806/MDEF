  <h3> Atlas of Weak Signals </h3>

  -This course was an extension of “what’s your fight” but giving it more meaning and tracing how your fight will relate to the repository of drivers and weak signals
  - We created our design spaces on Miro Board where I could see everyone’s interests co-relating and offering a very interesting space to collaborate
  -I want to see how this space will shape my journey further and use this as an iterative space to inform my work
  -I created an are.na board to start building layers of connection to my topic- “cli-fi ways of communication”. I wish to explore the socio-technical aspects of our digital lives in the shared ecosystem we are all living in. So the approach I’m taking is looking at the meta-human aspect critically (short-termism, attention economy, disconnecting from the real world) and promote holistic fluid understanding.
    <h5> Cards my fight resonated with </h5>

  <h5>Someone I would like to work with: IAM, Barcelona </h5>

  Notes from their website which resonated with my beliefs and work I would want to contribute to
<li>
  (re)designing systems to better understand the complexity of the interrelationships and interdependence between digital economy and environmental emergency</li>
<li>  concept of “intercitizenships”</li>
  <li>sustainable futures for the internet(s)</li>
  <li>the awareness of the relationship between personal experience and wider society
  beyond the very “human centred design” selfish greed. A product of individualism, extractivism lifestyles and unimaginable wealth concentration</li>
  <li>to contribute to a transition from the individualism of a user-centric digital economy to the interdependence of digital ecosystems driven the the internet citizens.  Learn how to become “inter citizens’</li>
  <li>to reimagine our shared sense of identity of humans, in relation to the digitalised society we are all building where billions of persons are reduces to individualised consumers</li>
  <li>focusing on ‘inter’- reciprocal interrelation</li>
  <li>activate a border sense of belonging to planet earth enabled by the internet that includes non-human beings in practice values as humbleness, responsibility, accountability, plurality, empathy, tolerance and solidarity.</li>
  <li>we need to see the internet as physical, entangled, public network infrastructures. Understanding material dimensions and scale of digital economy is a critical factor</li>
  <li>minerals required to make iPhones, energy consumption</li>
  <li>invisible and complex ways that the digital economy is interconnected to massive socio-ecological crisis (NFT)</li>
  <li>ecological framework (inside a digital economy)</li>
  <li>collective imaginations</li>
  <li>changing humans complicated relationship with ecology</li>
  <li>what if we collectively decide to spend our time, attention, money and use data in a different way?<li>

  <h5>Experiments I would want to do:</h5>
  <li>changing the language on the present screen medium for the purpose of climate literacy</li>

  <li>show the digital carbon impact on the real  ecosystem (simple acts of search engine, scrolling)
  <li>experiment related to collective use of electricity (if the limit is exceeded how does it affect the collective system, like a plant dies?)
  <li>designing systems inconveniently to re-engineer old habits of extractionism and greed
  <li>looking at how a flower communicates to the roots (which exists since billions of years) as a way of passing information in the most sustainable affairs

  <h5>Skill I would like to develop:</h5>

  p5.js and arduino for re-designing interface interactions for the existing screens
  material development for exploring bottom-up and ways of “growing” unconventional communication ( peugeot patina effect that shows the signs of use and builds up emotional connection)

   <h5>Setting up my RtD ToolBox</h5>

   <p>Before diving into building my future toolbox, I wanted to position myself in the multitude of designerly roles one I can see myself being a part of.</p>
   <p>Oscar presented to us Ways of Drifting: Methods of Experimentation in RtD process. The following were the ones that resonated and can possibly serve as explanatory tools for the research questions I want to address. Thnking about this, demanded me to reflect back on my thought process and analyze it carefully.<ul>
    <li>Accumulative (going inwards, depth, from broad to narrow like dissecting a hyperobject theme like climate emergency, tech utopia)
    <li>Probing (personal pursuit, artistic-based design research, draw connections from different disciplines)
    </ul>
<p>While doing this activity, I realised that I use the accumulative to narrow down to my research brief (contracting) and probing to initiate the relating process by drawing parallels to different disciplines.</p>
<p>Based on the context and the trigger cards I've chosen, the role of protoyping would be more of research archetypes which are more like physical embodiments of concepts as a ways of contributing to the discipline. Something that is more symbolic in nature and also present a 'catalogue of possiblities'</p>
<h5>My Design Space:</h5>
  <h5>objects/initiatives that represent the issue I'm enquiring in a tangible way (projects, pictures, keyword, blueprints)</h5>

<h5>My Design Experiment</h5>
<h5>Goal: How to highlight the invisible connections between actions and consequences while using digital communication technologies.</h5>
<p>In order to collapse the illusion of 'now' and 'then' that is created while using the devices; I borrowed principles from anti-othering. It makes one think about the relationship of casualities holistically (like an entangelment of web you are part of). This series re-imagines ways of making 'time' and 'space' redundant.
<h3>Mediating between foreground and background </h3>
<p>Looking from the perspective of deep time, we are extracting Earthâ€™s history to serve a split second of technological time, in order to serve 'services' than are often designed to be used for no more than a few minutes. I created a video performance exposing a system of exploitation, transmission and consumption made slightly visible through a layer of being 'there'.</p>

   <h5>My thoughts on the city</h5>
  <p> Before coming to Barcelona (my first ever entry point into Europe), I knew this city was one of those very carefully planned cities with tons of expats staying whilst bringing in their own cultures. So for me I was beyond excited to make this city as my home/ my space/ my new family for the next months to come by.

  In terms of visual (architechturally speaking), Barcelona is not so different than Hyderabad (the place I was born and brought up). The islamic style is very much resonating, and to my surprise both these cities were ruled by and taken over by Arabs that left their residues back here. But I was very much taken back by the thoughts that were put into building Eixample neighbourhood (one of the first areas to be extended). It was brain-child of Ildefons Cerdà, a socialist who wished everyone to have an egalitatrian kind of everyday life (so the street and building structures look the same) and the octagonal blocks were built for maximum sunlight and ventitlation. Seeing a project like this come to life that impacted someone's everyday life was a hope in itself. A hope for new beginnings to emerge.

<h5>Why MDEF</h5>

  <p> To be fair enough there are a lot of options if one wants to learn solely skills or orint towards research in a partciular field. But I personally have chosen to go forward with this course is ironically because there is no particular curicullum in specific. The aim is to not build a project but yourself and your practice which definetely seems more enriching. I love the flexibility and the kind of ambiguity the structure of the course itself has to offer. You stay most accountable to yoursel in such a manner. The course also seems to dissect your existing thoughts and then amalgamate different disciplines together meaningfully.

  <h5>My fight</h5>

  <p>As an ice-breaker sessions/kick-off activity, we had to present a poster about what's your fight? It was ofcourse diffeicult to tag something 'fight' as it transitions from professional to personal. That feeling itself was so new and to be honest uncomfortable to deal with. To start finding a common thread in my interests, I briefly looked at my old projects I did during univerisity and thesis. What I could analyse was that I was always curious about finding other ways of communication. I took a critical take on the present media and communication devices and proposed for other 'elements' which seem to be missing (intentionally) to serve one set of people in society better. The concept of 'information' and how mis- use of it can lead to conflicts and friction between nations. The sense of shared reality is what I thought was missing. </p>
 <h5> Things I find interesting: Design + Anthropology + Technology </h5>

  <h5>My future kit: strength, knowledge and attitude</h5>
  <p> The next exercise after picking what's your fight was to think how to reach there. Basically a road map to your future self. But before detailing out the journey, I wanted to think and gather about what kind of resources do I have now and what I want to build up on. We got to schedule quick “meetings” with our peers and discuss our strengths, attitude and knowledge together. I resonated and borrowed their keywords and later added to my list too- “think less, do more” from Jose, “ out of my comfort zone” from Gerda, "glass-blowing" from Vikrant.</p>
  <p>But before writing down my future persona(s), I made a quick list of people I look upto and why briefly.

    <ul>
  <li> Ted Hunt, Maggie Appleton, Nadia Piet, Nicolas Nova, Iohanna Nicenboim,  Ilja Panić, - design research, mataphorical way of conceptualising </li>
  <li> Nicole He,  Maria Panken, Pia Marie, Simone Rebaudengo. - designed objects, interactive environments </li>
  <li>Isha Pimphalkhare, Nicole Vindel, Maud Bausier, Allison Parrish, Domitille Debret - art of making and experimenting, research through material,

  <h5>Reflections</h5>
<ul>
<li>
  During our first class in elisava, we were introduced to alumni projects. Going through them we realised that framing and working through “interventions” is more enriching and fruitful in terms of making an impact and also understanding yourself during the process- situated learning
</li>

<li>
  Oscar which upon interaction has just proven the fact that nothing needs to be just blindly followed, everything has to be dissected and anaylsed to simulatenously go inwards but also equally outwards to prjoect your view of the world and make it real.
</li>

<li>  I remember while sharing our feelings/thoughts with our classmates about starting this new journey together, one of our friend, Chris mentioned how he feels priveleged to be here. I would 100% agree to this. That word captures my exact state of emotions right now. This place is always bustling with so much energy and curious people; a fertile ground to learn and work together.

</ul>
<h5>My plan for Term-1:</h5>

  <h5>My Personal graph:</h5>
<p>I prepared a personal graph to log my engagement in the following variables that I think will help me trasiiton from where I am to where I wish to be:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Community Engagement (in the bcn city and online)</li>
  <li>Spending time experimenting and making prototypes to provoke discussion</li>
  <li>Communicating my vision to mentors and working on the feedback </li>
  <li>Building on field-knowledge (books, videos, podcasts)</li>
  <li>Getting projects out of the classroom (kickstarter etc)</li>
</ul>

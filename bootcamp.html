  <h3> Reflection </h3>
   <h5>The city </h5>

  <p>I arrived on September 9th, three weeks before the course officially started and the journey so far has been beyond beautiful. It is safe to say I'm in love with this city. It’s my first time in Europe, the difference is unparalleled but there are also a few similarities that remind me of home; Hyderabad. The islamic elements in the architecture are very resonating to the place I was born and brought up for the last 21 years. The city is always bustling with activities. Coming to a place like this after staying at home for the last 2 years (covid-19) keeps one amused about what all one can do collectively. It is very liberating to be here both in terms of shaping my practice and personally to be in a very different cultural setting and as Chris summed it up, sometimes you feel “privileged” to be in the city and at mdef. </p>

<h5>  Why am I here and What’s my fight? </h5>

  <p>If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?” - Albert Einstein

  The sole reason I applied for this course is to understand and work with intersectionalities. It’s interesting to see how multiple things come together like a “melting pot” and thinking and intervening in this space opens up new ways of functioning. Mdef is based around acting first and experimenting, and avoid over-theorising </p>

  <h5> Things i enjoy: Design + Anthropology + Technology </h5>

  <p>We had to work on a poster- what's your fight? It was a bit overwhelming to categorise things as my “fight” because I have never seen myself committed to any topic, nothing beyond being passionate. What was a shift was you consider it no work in the “work” realm, it becomes very personal. Just accepting something like that to be a part of your extension is what I was afraid of. But I enjoyed how this exercise demanded me to take a detour and look at my previous projects, what I read in a new light - to find a pattern in the way I think and process my thoughts. A common thread in my work is information. After talking to my mentor, Jon, I realised this.  </p>



    <ul>
    -The first week reinforced the fact that we are here to form our own opinions and connect with what we are interested in rather than pretending what is right or what is wrong or what seems to be “important” </ul>
  <ul>
    -During our first class in elisava, we were introduced to alumni projects. Going through them we realised that framing and working through “interventions” is more efficient and fruitful in terms of making an impact and also understanding yourself during the process- situated learning
  </ul>

  <ul>
    -Engaging with the community like how clement (in the previous year) was very interesting as he wasn't even familiar with th language and he was able to bring an entire community together through a public space project.
  </ul>

  <ul>
    -We got to schedule “meetings” with our peers and discuss our strengths, attitude and knowledge together. I picked up “think less, do more” from jose, “food science” from vikrant, “being more out of my comfort zone” from gerda.
  </ul>


  <h5>Devising a routine and follow-up after every week</h5>

  <p>I prepared a rough graph after the who I am and who I want to be exercise Oscar shared with us in the class. The inputs were produced from within, post-interaction with my peers and looking at the work done by the mdef alumni. It was very inspiring to see how each course learning turned out for them and now I'm curious how mine will turn out too eventually. This exercise is exciting as it’s a nice sneak-peek into my future self skills and knowledge (haha trying my best not to build what Mariana calls “cathedral” projects).</p>

  <p>I see major sources of my inspiration to be from reading. So I would like to continue that and dig more into audio formats as well (I believe abstract content is much easier to understand in this format and also away from the screen haha). But ultimately I would want to focus more on more surroundings, pick up cues by observing, seeing patterns and getting more of the “first-hand” knowledge rather than reading it through someone else’s eyes. </p>

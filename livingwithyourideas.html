  <h3> Living with your own ideas </h3>
  <p>This course was about learning to adopt a way of living with your own ideas and prototypes. The last week was super out-of-comfort zone as it I'd to address an idea actively. Extreme reflection and criticism are the two words I would want to describe this module as.</p>
  <h5> Alternative Presents </h5>
  <p> We were introduced to the concept of alternative presents, an autobiographical, RtD approach that draws from speculative design. What was interesting about this approach- it is not anymore about the imagining  of a speculative future, but the experiencing of a speculative present.</p>
      <h5> Crafts-machine-ship </h5>
<p>Crafts-machine-ship is the attempt to share our autonomy with the machine. That is, in which ways can we make together rather than delegating the making to the machine? Making use of open-ended making to engage participants in the imagination of new things was interesting. I still have to figure out how this experiment can provoke a sort of discussion or expand conventional trajectory.

<h5>Guided Reflection </h5>

<p>While doing this experiment, I got few insights into how my thought pattern works and what kind of a user (for the lack of better word) I am. This was like a nomdic practice where we had to shift gears of thinking and doing very quick and in a way force connections and see how two things that are unrelated could be related. The practice of doing and then reflecting, instead of "testing" or "demonstrating" could be a possible window of new pracice I would want to engage more in.</p>

<h5>What did you make? Why did it matter?</h5>
<p>My attempt was to break-free from the present habit of the way I consume information everyday and look at alternatives. I feel like we have become used to informaton being supplied to us- majorly in form of newsfeed format like on twitter, instagram which eventually frame our individual and collective thinking and questioning capacities and practices. I want to put myself in a knowledge production positionality rather than knowledge consumption for the next 7 days. So I looked at my recent internet history, it was loaded with "best places to visit in europe during new year". I was gathering information and making notes as my brother would be coming here to spend new year with me and I'd to be responsible to make sure he has fun in a way. So I took this challenge of finding my next spot out in my neighbourhood instead of google suggesting me places. I went around asking strangers where do they think I should spend my new year - France or Portugal. It was refeshing as I focused on one single question for the entire day and actualy reflected on what I want and what I resonate with rather than clicking on links that were arranged on the basis of page ranking. I think during a longer duration of not using my feed as a way of get information, I hope to understand and categorise what kind of information is something I "need" and which one was just junk.</p>

<h5>What happens when you involve yourself?</h5>
<p>It has been almost 48 hours since I have been using this way of finding out answers to my "natural" questions. I realised majority of my questions were picked from my direct surroundings (it felt like the information I consumed on social media platforms was more top-bottom and less of horizontal sharing). I also felt this pressure in between few hours to learn a new fact or a piece of information. I was aware of what exactly I'm learning or reading because there was no overflow of new information as such. I weirdly felt "available" every time as I'd nothing to go back to an online "shell" to kill time. The process was fueled by curiosity,instincts and reflexivity. </p>

<h5>What happens when you use yourself as an instrument?</h5>
<p>I've personally used materials during the final stage like emodiment of an idea. But this was my first time using material and my body itself as a prototype. Hands-down it was super tough to take the first step when I had to make the box itself where I planned to hang it aorund my neck with paper chits and pencil where people can vote. But after a few attempts, I started having fun. And that's when I wasn't conscious anymore and could gather insights.I also realised when you search on google, I also felt like it was a guerilla protest against algorithms and finding answers organically through people and letting chance and randomness be a fundamental concept of this kind of questioning.</p>

<h5>Did anything change about your way of working?</h5>
<p>I felt so less distracted and could channel my thoughts only on what felt important. I realised not being on any social media platform has made changes to my routine itself. Especially how I start and end my day. But not being on social media also made me feel distant from my friends back at home and not receiving and providing any updates is tough. I started using WhatsApp more often and the communication that happened on whatsapp was very different and felt more personal. I realised the easiest way to "react" to any news was heavily through emojis on instagram. I felt like this project exposed an underlying desire I would want to integerate in my life.</p>

<h5>What does it mean for your future work?</h5>
<p>I'm not very sure how this is directly going to be linked to the final project. But just the concept of this assignment- to go out with your body in the environment makes your feel more comfortable with the idea you are trying to study. It doesn't feel its growing in a dark box where no one gets to see or contribute. It's also easy to convey the idea and make changes more often. The experiment falls under guerilla ways of sourcing information and processing, non-attention economy, shared reality in an age of abundance. I would want to incorporate more of the material speculation practices. It also made me think how embodying an idea like this helps to examine socio-cultural perspective without any need for technological advancements.</p>
